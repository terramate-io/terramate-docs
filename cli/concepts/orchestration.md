# Orchestration Concepts

Orchestration executes commands across stacks using a graph-based model that respects dependencies and ordering.

## Key ideas

- Single-command execution with `terramate run`
- Workflow execution with `terramate script run`
- Change detection to reduce execution scope
- Sequential and parallel execution with order guarantees
