# Start with existing OpenTofu Projects

## Import Existing OpenTofu Stacks

To create Terramate Stacks from existing OpenTofu Root Modules run the following command.

At the moment we support OpenTofu over the Terraform Integration as most details are still identical.

```bash
terramate create --all-terraform
```

This command will detect existing OpenTofu Root modules and create a stack configuration in them.
