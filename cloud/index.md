# Terramate Cloud

Terramate Cloud is the management and observability layer for infrastructure operations driven by Terramate CLI.

## What it provides

- Deployment and drift visibility across stacks and repositories
- Collaboration features for previews and ownership
- Alerting and integrations (for example, Slack and GitHub)
- Organization-level governance and controls

## How it fits the platform

Terramate CLI executes infrastructure workflows; Terramate Cloud receives metadata and status to provide insight and coordination.
