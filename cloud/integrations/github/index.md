# GitHub Integration

Terramate Cloud integrates with GitHub by providing a [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/terramate-cloud) that
can be installed in your personal GitHub account or your GitHub organization. Installing our GitHub App allows you to
use features such as **rendered plan previews** in Pull Requests, automated **Pull Request approvals**,
**status checks**, **policies**, and more.

## Features

Using the GitHub App to integrate Terramate Cloud and GitHub enables several features:

### Rendered Plans

For every new plan preview created with Terramate CLI, the GitHub App will provide a rendered version of each plan
inside Pull Requests, clearly highlighting destructive changes. This allows your team to better understand changes introduced
in Pull Requests without having to understand complex Terraform and OpenTofu plans.

Each rendered comes with a link to the Pull Request preview in Terramate Cloud,  allowing you to see the ASCII Plan, logs
from GitHub Actions and more.
