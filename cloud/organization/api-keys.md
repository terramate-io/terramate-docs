# Create and manage API keys

If you are an organization admin, you can create and manage API keys for use with the Terramate CLI or to interact with the Terramate Cloud API.

## How to create an API key

::: info
When you create an API key, Terramate Cloud will only display the key only once upon successful creation â€“ ensure that it is in a safe spot.
Creating a new key is required if lost.
:::

To create an API key:
1. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the sidebar of the **Settings** page of your Terramate Cloud dashboard.
2. Click on the **Create API Key** button.
