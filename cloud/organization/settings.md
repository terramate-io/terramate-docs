![Terramate Cloud Organization General Settings](../assets/general-settings.png "Terramate Cloud Organization General Settings")

Sync your complete GitHub/GitLab organization or specific repos with Terramate Cloud via. Organization. To collaborate with your team members on Terramate Cloud, you can create a new Organization or join an existing one.

## General Settings

These settings give your new organization an identity to refer to and enable full features of the Terramate Cloud. You can change these fields only if you're an `admin`.

- `Short Name`: The short name is the string which will be used in URLs (https://cloud.terramate.io/o/{short-name}) when visiting the organization or in Terramate CLI when selecting the organization to sync or receive data from. You can only set it when creating a new organization. You cannot change it afterwards. Please get in touch with our support for more details.

- `Display Name`: The Display name is the publicly visible name of your Terramate Organization, which will appear in different places, like in the invitation emails to your teammates to join the `display name` organization.

## Setup VCS Open ID Connect (OIDC)

When syncing data with Terramate CLI from your VCS such as GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, we recommend you use Open ID Connect (OIDC)
instead of api keys. For that you can establish trust relationship between your VCS provider and Terramate Cloud.

- `GitHub Trust`: Set up OpenID Connect(OIDC), which allows Terramate CLI to sync data from GitHub Actions to Terramate Cloud. You can do this by entering one of the following types of values in this field:
    - a GitHub Organization/Owner to trust all repositories within a GitHub Organization of the form `owner`
    - a comma-separated list of GitHub Organizations/Owners of the form `ownerA`, `ownerB`, `ownerC`
    - a GitHub repository to trust a single repository within a GitHub Organization of the form `owner/repository`
    - a comma-separated list of GitHub repositories ofthe form `organizationA/repository`, `organizationB/repository`

- `GitLab Trust`: Similar to the `GitHub Trust` field, you can enter a value which will set up OIDC to sync data from GitLab CI to Terramate Cloud. You can visit this [page](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/automation/gitlab-ci/#terramate-cloud-integration) to see more details about connecting Terramate Cloud to GitLab CI. The following values are supported:
    - a GitLab Organization/Owner to trust all repositories within a GitLab Organization of the form `owner`
    - a comma-separated list of GitLab Organizations/Owners of the form `ownerA`, `ownerB`, `ownerC`
    - a GitLab Repository to trust a single repository within a GitHub Organization of the form `owner/repository`
    - a comma-separated list of GitLab repositories ofthe form `organizationA/repository`, `organizationB/repository`
