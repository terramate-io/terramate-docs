- `Terraform Address`: Links the resource to its Terraform configuration, making it easy to locate and manage in your code.
- `Created Time`: The timestamp when the resource was added, useful for auditing its lifecycle.
- `Updated Time`: The timestamp of the last status update helps you monitor recent changes.

- `Target`: Specifies the environment where the resource is deployed, clarifying its role.
- `Policy Checks`: Lists the policy checks applied to the resource to ensure it meets your organizationâ€™s standards.
- `Current State`: Displays the resource's attributes, combining those set by the infrastructure (e.g., a Google Cloud bucket's self_link) with those defined in your code (e.g., the bucket's name). It's marked as `Outdated` if the last deployment has newer planned changes.
- `Current drift`: Displays any differences between the deployed state and the desired configuration. It is marked as `Outdated` if there is a newer deployment.
- `Last Deployment`: Displays the most recent deployment details, including the user who initiated it and whether it was triggered manually. It is marked as `Outdated` if the current state is newer.
