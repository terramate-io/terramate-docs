# Resources

Resources in the Terramate Cloud dashboard lets teams manage all their infrastructure assets from one place. It monitors resources deployed with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) across multiple VCS providers, repositories, and teams, giving you a complete picture of your infrastructure. The dashboard displays `healthy` and `unhealthy` resources, enabling teams to quickly identify drifted or misconfigured assets based on deployment outcomes and drift runs.

The Resources page displays all known resources across multiple repositories. Each resource shows key metadata such as its name, associated account, stack name, provider name, number of checks, and repository. You can sort the list—by default, resources are arranged by the time of their last update—and use filters to narrow results by repository or status. Additionally, you can search for resources by entering a search string in the name or path. Clicking on any resource opens its [Resource Details](./details.md) page.
